# DeltaSql
An application to help compare the differences between MS SQL Servers.

## Base
This project uses my [LTT-WPF-Application](https://github.com/AaronAmberman/LTT-WPF-Application) template for the application. Please check it out if you are starting a new WPF application and want built in logging (with rolling logs, roll size can be customized), has built in light and dark themes and has a built in translation mechanism.

## Progress
This project has been abandoned be of this Azure Data Studio free extension. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/extensions/schema-compare-extension. At the time of writing this the Schema Compare extension was free.
